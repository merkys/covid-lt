7CAI	S1 NTD poorly modelled, epitope (H) mainly at 378 beta sheet, beta sheets at epitope poorly aligned.
7R6W	beta sheets (including S1's 378, with H) at epitope are well-aligned.
7CWN	S1 NTD poorly modelled, L chain CTD poorly modelled, beta sheets at epitope (H) poorly aligned.
7M7B	S1 CTD poorly modelled, H chain CTD poorly modelled, 378 sheet contacts with helix in L.
7SWP	epitope contains S1 378 sheet with H chain's protrusion culminating at 107, seen in the original struct.
7TLY	epitope: S1 helices 340 (with H) and 440 (with L), no RBM or beta sheet contacts.
7TC9	epitope: L contacts with RBM, H contacts with 348 (sheet?)
7S0E	epitope: H/L contact mostly with CTD1.
7SOC	epitope: S1 helices 340 (with H) and 440 (with L), no RBM or beta sheet contacts.
7E3B	epitope: H contacts with antiparallel sheets 450 & 490 of RBM, loop 347.
7R8L	epitope: L/S1 intersheet loops, H/S1 sheets of RBM.
7NEG	epitope: L/S1 intersheet loops, H/S1 sheets of RBM.
7NX8	epitope: L/S1 intersheet loops, H/S1 sheets of RBM.
7CZT	S1 NTD poorly modelled, epitope: H/S1 and L/S1 sheets of RBM.
7WEB	epitope: H/S1 sheets of RBM.
7E3O	epitope: H and L with sheets of RBM.
7NY5	epitope: H and L with RBM, far removed from the rest.
7WD0	epitope: H and L with RBM, far removed from the rest.
7K8Y	epitope: H/S1 sheets of RBM.
7LXW	mainly H interaction with S1 sheets at 140 and 155 and space in between them.
7LY0	H contacts with loop culminating at 250, L with S1 sheets at 140 and 155 and space in between them.
7C2L	H chain CTD poorly modelled, H inserts a loop between sheets (?) at 145 and 250.
7NTC	S1 contacts with H and L with inter-sheet loops of NTD.
7D4G	S1 contacts with L at 238 loop, with H at 133 (all NTD).
7RW2	H binds to S1 by inserting helix 126 into beta barrel-like structure at NTD.
7LAB	epitope lacks a lot of residues in the pristine PDB, most likely an error due to that.
7N8I	epitope: contacts with H only, S1 sheet 85 (NTD).
7TM0	epitope: contacts with H only, S1 sheet 85 (NTD). H is enveloped by S1.
7WD8	S1 CTD1 only, epitope: H with 535 loop, L with 555.

7K9Z	H with RBM, L with 355 sheet.
6XKP	H with RBM.
7RXD	H well aligned with 495 sheet, but large portion of RBD is missing in pristine PDB and is poorly modelled.
7EJ4	L mainly with RBM
7TP4	no RBM contacts, H mainly with intersheet loops
6YM0	H with 380 sheet
7QNW	H/L with 380 sheet
