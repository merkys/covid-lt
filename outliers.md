S1–ACE2
=======

* 7RPV: seems OK.
* 7SY6: incomplete structure is completed by Jackal, resulting in unrealistic intertwining.
* 7V87: incomplete structure is completed by Jackal, resulting in unrealistic intertwining.
* 7VX4: incomplete structure is completed by Jackal, resulting in unrealistic intertwining.

S1–antibody
===========

* 5DO2: interactions very scattered most likely due to virus being MERS.
* 5W9K: interaction in S1 CTD due to (most likely) virus being MERS.
* 5W9N: MERS, S1 CTD completed by Jackal.
* 7E5S: "antibody cocktail" with 4 different antibodies, thus legit.
* 7EH5: incomplete structure is completed by Jackal, resulting in unrealistic intertwining.
* 7WK8: interactions outside S1 528-593 are due to these parts being modelled de novo by Jackal.
