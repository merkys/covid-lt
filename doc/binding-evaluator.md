The following terms were calculated for every pair of mutated/wild type complexes:

* CADscore and dS are global contact score and the difference in contact area, respectively, as calculated by voronota-cadscore from Voronota v1.22.3149 software package [doi:10.1002/jcc.23538].
  Difference in contact area is calculated by subtracting wild type complex area from the mutated complex contact area.

* ddG is the binding interaction score of a protein-protein complex as calculated by EvoEF [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30851277/].

* SA_part and SA_com are surface accessible areas of the mutated residues in wild type complexes as calculated by DSSP.
  For multiple mutations, areas of the mutated residues are summed.

* CS is the change of evolutionary conservation of mutated sites upon introducing mutations, calculated using the PROVEAN software package [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23056405/].
  For PROVEAN the NR database from August 2011 was used as provided on PROVEAN FTP server, as newer NR releases were incompatible with PROVEAN.
