The following terms were calculated for every pair of mutated/wild type complexes:

* ddG is the binding interaction score of a protein-protein complex as calculated by EvoEF.

* CS is the change of evolutionary conservation of mutated sites upon introducing mutations, calculated using the PROVEAN software package.
  For PROVEAN the NR database from August 2011 was used as provided on PROVEAN FTP server, as newer NR releases were incompatible.
