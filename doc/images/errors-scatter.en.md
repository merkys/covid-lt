Figure displays the correlation between errors in ddG estimates (in kcal/mol) produced by models trained on our and MutaBind2 terms.
The black line represents the diagonal (ideal correlation of 1) and the red line represents the real correlation between the errors.
The plot displays the general trend of our model to produce estimates closer to the experimental ddG values.
