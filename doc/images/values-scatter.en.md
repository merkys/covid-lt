Figure displays the correlation of different absolute ddG values: estimated using our model ('our'), estimated using a model trained on MutaBind2 terms ('mutabind2') and experimental ('ddG').
All values are in kcal/mol.
In each of the plots black line represents the diagonal (ideal correlation of 1) and red line represents the real correlation between the values in consideration.
Plots show that both produced models tend to derive more conservative estimates of ddG when compared to the experimental ddG values.
