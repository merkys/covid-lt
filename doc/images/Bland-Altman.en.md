Figure shows the Bland-Altman plot of absolute ddG values (in kcal/mol) estimated by models trained on our and MutaBind2 terms.
The plot shows that the mean difference (middle dashed line) is shifted towards larger values, meaning that our model tends to estimate larger values than one trained on MutaBind2 terms.
The lower and upper dashed lines mark 1.96 standard deviations below and above the mean difference.
Few data points lie above the 1.96 standard deviation limit displaying the tendency of our model to produce larger estimates.
