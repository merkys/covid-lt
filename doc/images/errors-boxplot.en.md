Figure displays a boxplot of errors in ddG estimates (in kcal/mol) produced by models trained on our and MutaBind2 terms.
From the boxplot it is evident that average error of the two models are very close and both models are biased towards producing larger ddG estimates that experimental values.
It is also worth noting that our model results in outliers to the greater values of ddG, while model trained on MutaBind2 terms produces lower ddG values.
