* 1:

    * 7CAI: S1 NTD poorly modelled, epitope (H) mainly at 378 beta sheet, beta sheets at epitope poorly aligned.
    * 7R6W: beta sheets (including S1's 378, with H) at epitope are well-aligned.
    * 7CWN: S1 NTD poorly modelled, L chain CTD poorly modelled, beta sheets at epitope (H) poorly aligned.
    * 7M7B: S1 CTD poorly modelled, H chain CTD poorly modelled, 378 sheet contacts with helix in L.
    * 7SWP: epitope contains S1 378 sheet with H chain's protrusion culminating at 107, seen in the original struct.

* 2:

    * 7TLY: epitope: S1 helices 340 (with H) and 440 (with L).
    * 7TC9: epitope: L contacts with 378 sheet, some contacts with antiparallel sheets connected with loop culminating at 482 (mostly L).
    * 7S0E: epitope: H/L contact with 558 loop.
    * 7SOC: epitope: S1 helices 340 (with H) and 440 (with L).
    * 7E3B: epitope: no L contacts, H contacts with antiparallel sheets 450 & 490, loop 347.

* 3:

    * 7R8L: epitope: L/S1 quite far from sheet 495 (rather short sheet), H/S1 mainly at antiparallel sheets connected with loop culminating at 482.
    * 7NEG: epitope: L/S1 quite far from sheet 495 (rather short sheet), H/S1 mainly at antiparallel sheets connected with loop culminating at 482.
    * 7NX8: epitope: L/S1 quite far from sheet 495 (rather short sheet), H/S1 mainly at antiparallel sheets connected with loop culminating at 482.
    * 7CZT: S1 NTD poorly modelled, epitope: H/S1 sheet 495, L/S1 mainly at antiparallel sheets connected with loop culminating at 482.

* 4:

    * 7WEB: epitope: H contacts with antiparallel sheets connected with loop culminating at 482.
    * 7E3O: epitope: H contacts with sheets 490 and 495, loop 482.
    * 7NY5: H/S1 mainly at antiparallel sheets connected with loop culminating at 482.
    * 7WD0: H/S1 mainly at antiparallel sheets connected with loop culminating at 482.
    * 7K8Y: H/S1 not far from sheet 495 (rather short sheet), H/S1 mainly at antiparallel sheets connected with loop culminating at 482.

* 5 (NTD):

    * 7LXW: mainly H interaction with S1 sheets at 140 and 155 and space in between them.
    * 7LY0: H contacts with loop culminating at 250, L with S1 sheets at 140 and 155 and space in between them.
    * 7C2L: H chain CTD poorly modelled, H inserts a loop between sheets (?) at 145 and 250.

* 6 (NTD):

    * 7NTC: S1 contacts with H and L with inter-sheet loops of NTD.
    * 7D4G: S1 contacts with L at 238 loop, with H at 133 (all NTD).
    * 7RW2: H binds to S1 by inserting helix 126 into beta barrel-like structure at NTD.

* 7 (anomaly):

    * 7LAB: epitope lacks a lot of residues in the pristine PDB, most likely an error due to that.

* 8 (NTD):

    * 7N8I: epitope: contacts with H only, S1 sheet 85 (NTD).
    * 7TM0: epitope: contacts with H only, S1 sheet 85 (NTD). H is enveloped by S1.
    * 7WD8: S1 CTD1 only, epitope: H with 535 loop, L with 555.
