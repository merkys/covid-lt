Clusters were identified by choosing cutting height of 140 in hierarchical clustering result.
The outcome is 16 clusters.

Cluster 1
---------

Antibodies in Cluster 1 contact mostly with S1 beta strand containing aminoacid 380 (heavy chain).
Most frequent antibodies found in this cluster are CR3022, EY6A and S304.
CR3022 has originated from a patient recovered from SARS [https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/04/14/antibody-points-to-possible-weak-spot-on-novel-coronavirus/].
EY6A [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0480-y] and COVA1-16 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7687367/] have been isolated from a patient recovering from COVID-19

Cluster 2
---------

Antibodies in Cluster 2 contact mostly with S1 helices containing residues 340 (heavy chain) and 440 (light chain).
Most frequently seen antibody is S309, but it is not the only one.

Cluster 3
---------

This cluster is the most populous one with over 200 entries.
Contacts are mostly concentrated at the RBM (either both heavy and light antibody chains, sometimes just heavy), some contacts are observed with loops of S1 beta sheet region (usually light chains).
Antibody LY-COV555 (Bamlanivimab) is seen in this cluster, originating from recovering COVID-19 patient [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.30.318972v3].

Cluster 4
---------

Contacts are mostly concentrated at the RBM, usually it is the heavy antibody chain that is located closest to the RBM.
Cluster is composed of many different antibodies.

Cluster 5
---------

Cluster is defined mostly by antibody contacts with beta strand containing S1 position 355.
However, the same is observed in Cluster 4 too.
S1 structures in this cluster are very well aligned, some variation is observed in antibody structures.
There are contacts with RBM, but these do not seem to be conserved.
Three out of four complexes containing antibody COVOX-45 are found in this cluster.
No sources seem to mention the origin of COVOX-45.

Cluster 6
---------

...

Cluster 7
---------

Antibodies in this cluster contact with S1 NTD, specifically, with strands containing residues 145 and 250.
Cluster is composed of many different antibodies.

Cluster 8
---------

Antibodies in this cluster contact mostly with beta strand containing S1 position 378.
Contacts with RBM are very rare.
Cluster is composed of many different antibodies.
Cluster contains antibody H014 which was extracted from mice and humanized [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc5881].

Cluster 9
---------

OLD
===

Contacts are concentrated at S1's NTD, mainly at loop containing residue 90 and protruding beta hairpin of 180-200.
Cluster is composed of different antibodies, but they align well.

NEW
===

Contacts are mostly conserved at RBD loops.
Contacts with RBM are not very well conserved.
Most frequent antibody is COVA1-16.

Cluster 10
----------

Both antibody chains in Cluster 10 contact with inter-sheet loops at S1's NTD.
Cluster is composed of different antibodies.

Cluster 11
----------

This cluster seems to be an artefact as it can be broken into three sub-clusters having no epitope overlap.

Cluster 12
----------

Cluster is composed of a single complex containing DH1052 antibody which is described as non-neutralizing, albeit reducing virus concentrations in infected mice [https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210106/Are-SARS-CoV-2-antibodies-associated-with-disease-enhancement.aspx].
The epitope of this complex lacks many residues in the original PDB file.

Cluster 13
----------

In the complexes of Cluster 13 heavy chains of antibodies contact with S1's NTD strand containing position 85.
S1 chains in these complexes "wrap" themselves around the antibodies.
All complexes in the cluster contain non-neutralizing antibody S2L20 [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl8506].

Cluster 14
----------

Cluster is made of three complexes containing two different antibodies.
In all of the complexes, heavy chain of the antibody binds to S1 by inserting a loop into beta barrel structure at S1's NTD.

Cluster 15
----------

This cluster contains a single complex, PDB ID 7UAR.
Antibody chains contact with beta strand around position 288 and loop regions of NTD.

Cluster 16
----------

All complexes in the cluster contain antibody S3H3 which is effective against Omicron variant [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04581-9].
Epitopes in this cluster are concentrated at S1's CTD1.
Contacts are well conserved in this cluster.
Model of PDB entry 7WD9 has a weird looking loop at around 625.
