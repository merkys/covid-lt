Clusters were identified by choosing cutting height of 135 in hierarchical clustering result.
The outcome is 16 clusters.

Cluster 1
---------

Antibodies in this cluster contact mostly with S1 beta strand containing aminoacid 380 and the following helix (both by heavy chain).
S1 and antibody chains overly very well.
Most frequent antibodies found in this cluster are CR3022, EY6A and S304.
CR3022 has originated from a patient recovered from SARS [https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/04/14/antibody-points-to-possible-weak-spot-on-novel-coronavirus/].
EY6A [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0480-y] and COVA1-16 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7687367/] have been isolated from a patient recovering from COVID-19.

Cluster 2
---------

Antibodies in this cluster contact mostly with S1 helices containing residues 340 (mostly heavy chains) and 440 (mostly light chains).
Most frequently seen antibody is S309, but it is not the only one.

Cluster 3
---------

This cluster is the most populous one with over 200 entries.
Contacts are mostly concentrated at the RBM (either both heavy and light antibody chains, sometimes just heavy), some contacts are observed with loops of S1 beta sheet region (usually light chains).
Antibody LY-COV555 (Bamlanivimab) is seen in this cluster, originating from recovering COVID-19 patient [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.30.318972v3].

Cluster 4
---------

Contacts are mostly concentrated at the RBM, usually it is the heavy antibody chain that is located closest to the RBM.
Contacts, mostly with light antibody chains, are observed with beta strand containing S1 position 355.
Cluster is composed of many different antibodies.

Cluster 5
---------

This cluster is defined mostly by antibody contacts with beta strand containing S1 position 355.
However, the same is observed in Cluster 4 too.
S1 structures in this cluster are very well aligned, some variation is observed in antibody structures.
There are contacts with RBM, but these do not seem to be conserved.
Three out of four complexes containing antibody COVOX-45 are found in this cluster.
No sources seem to mention the origin of COVOX-45.

FIXME: The epitope is N-terminal
FIXME: This may be confused with Cluster 4

Cluster 6
---------

Cluster is defined primarily by antibody contacts with beta strand containing S1 position 377.
RBM contacts are observed very rarely.
Cluster is composed of many different antibodies.

Cluster 7
---------

Antibodies in this cluster contact with loops connecting RBD beta strands with RBM.

Cluster 8 (NEW)
---------

Antibodies in this cluster contact with S1 NTD loops.
Cluster is composed of many different antibodies.

Cluster 8 (OLD)
---------

Antibodies in this cluster contact mostly with beta strand containing S1 position 378.
Contacts with RBM are very rare.
Cluster is composed of many different antibodies.
Cluster contains antibody H014 which was extracted from mice and humanized [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc5881].

Cluster 9 (NEW)
---------

Antibodies in this cluster contact with loops connecting RBD beta strands with RBM.

Cluster 9 (OLD)
---------

Contacts are mostly conserved at RBD loops.
Contacts with RBM itself are not very well conserved.
Most frequent antibody is COVA1-16.

Cluster 10 (NEW)
----------

Contacts in this cluster are very few and are concentrated at S1 CTD.
All antibodies in this cluster are 2G12.
Structures might not be well modelled in this cluster.

Cluster 10 (OLD)
----------

Both antibody chains in this cluster contact with inter-sheet loops at S1's NTD.
Cluster is composed of different antibodies.

Cluster 11 (NEW)
----------

Cluster is composed of a single complex containing DH1052 antibody which is described as non-neutralizing, albeit reducing virus concentrations in infected mice [https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210106/Are-SARS-CoV-2-antibodies-associated-with-disease-enhancement.aspx].
The epitope of this complex lacks many residues in the original PDB file.

Cluster 11 (OLD)
----------

This cluster seems to be an artefact as it can be broken into three sub-clusters having no epitope overlap.

Cluster 12
----------

In the complexes of this cluster heavy chains of antibodies contact with S1's NTD strand containing position 85.
S1 chains in these complexes "wrap" themselves around the antibodies.
All complexes in the cluster contain non-neutralizing antibody S2L20 [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl8506].

Cluster 13
----------

In this cluster heavy chain of the antibody binds to S1 NTD by inserting a loop into the beta barrel structure.

Cluster 14
----------

Cluster is made of one single complex, PDB ID 7S0E.
Antibody chains contact with S1 loops containing residues 520 and 560.
Antibody, N-612-007, has been reported to be partially neutralizing [https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CELREP.2022.110348].

Cluster 15
----------

This cluster contains a single complex, PDB ID 7UAR.
Antibody chains contact with beta strand around position 288 and loop regions of NTD.
Antibody, C1717, is reported to be neutralizing.

Cluster 16
----------

All complexes in the cluster contain antibody S3H3 which is effective against Omicron variant [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04581-9].
Epitopes in this cluster are concentrated at S1's CTD1.
Contacts are well conserved in this cluster.
Model of PDB entry 7WD9 has a weird looking loop at around 625.
