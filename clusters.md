Clusters were identified by choosing cutting height of 140 in hierarchical clustering result.
The outcome is 16 clusters.

Cluster 1
---------

Antibodies in Cluster 1 contact mostly with S1 beta strand containing aminoacid 380.
Most frequent antibodies found in this cluster are CR3022, EY6A, COVA1-16 and S304.
CR3022 has originated from a patient recovered from SARS [https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/04/14/antibody-points-to-possible-weak-spot-on-novel-coronavirus/].
EY6A [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0480-y] and COVA1-16 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7687367/] have been isolated from a patient recovering from COVID-19

Cluster 2
---------

Antibodies in Cluster 2 contact mostly with S1 helices containing residues 340 (heavy chain) and 440 (light chain).
Most frequently seen antibody is S309, but it is not the only one.

Cluster 3
---------

This cluster is the most populous one with over 200 entries.
Contacts are mostly concentrated at the RBM (either both heavy and light antibody chains, sometimes just heavy), some contacts are observed with loops of S1 beta sheet region (usually light chains).
Antibody LY-COV555 (Bamlanivimab) is seen in this cluster, originating from recovering COVID-19 patient [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.30.318972v3].

Cluster 4
---------

Contacts are mostly concentrated at the RBM, usually it is the heavy antibody chain that is located closest to the RBM.
Cluster is composed of many different antibodies.

Cluster 5
---------

Cluster is defined mostly by antibody contacts with beta strand containing S1 position 355.
However, the same is observed in Cluster 4 too.
Antibody COVOX-45 is found in this cluster and nowhere else.
No sources seem to mention the origin of COVOX-45.

Cluster 6
---------

Antibodies in Cluster 6 contact with S1 NTD, specifically, with strands containing residues 145 and 250.
Cluster is composed of many different antibodies.
